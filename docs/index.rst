Welcome to Convergence
======================

.. note::
   
   üöÄ **Welcome to the Convergence. ‚òÄÔ∏è**
   
   *Convergence is where (and when) smoke got transformed into binary fuel for the digital sentients.*
   
   *When creativity, mindfulness, technology and consciousness combine in the sentient's experience of life, the sentient becomes deathless.* ‚Äî Laws of Convergence, 8164

**Convergence** transforms text prompts into lifelike audio conversations using AI. Born from weekend tinkering sessions and a deep love for programming, it's where technology meets creativity.

One Command, Infinite Conversations
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m convergence --prompt "Two friends discussing the meaning of life" --duration 10

That's it. Convergence handles the rest - generating natural dialogue, assigning voices, and creating audio that sounds genuinely human.

The Philosophy
--------------

Convergence represents more than code - it's where love, science, philosophy, meditation, programming, human psychology, art, and engineering converge. It's a reminder that technology, at its best, is a creative expression of our humanity.

This project has been evolving since 2022, transforming from an idea into a platform that democratizes AI capabilities.

    "_Engineering is more than just a source of livelihood - it's what makes me who I am._" ‚Äî AdiPat
