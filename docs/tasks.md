# Convergence Tasks

1. Implement `/transcribe` using Open AI. Should include FastAPI endpoint and library methods. Manually test the endpoint and library calls. Make sure it's stateless.

2. Create live documentation page. Try ReDoc or GitBook. If we can self-host the Swagger docs, that will be good too. But let's not use Swagger, and use something more aesthetic and modern.

3. Publish package to pip. Do a fresh install and see if everything is working properly. Test for system dependencies, and see if we can test on Linux and Windows VM or VM machine too. Ensure a consistent experience across Operating Systems and document the setup instructions for each. Create a clear compatability and system requirements section in the README.

4. Move documentation out of README into a separate documentation file: SETUP.md, API_USAGE.md, SDK_USAGE.md, CONTRIBUTIONS.md and API_KEY_MANAGEMENT.md files in the docs folder.
