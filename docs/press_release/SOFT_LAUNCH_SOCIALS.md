Been super busy with work, but managed to spare a few hours for my routine weekend tinkering session. 🚀

This weekend, I built Convergence — a platform service to generate synthetic audio conversations.

./𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐬𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞

Simply provide the context and topic of your conversation, and Convergence generates a ready-to-listen audio file for your consumption.

You can generate group discussions, podcasts, mock standups, and tons of other classes of conversations — all via a flexible CLI or Postman!

Might build a simple UI for less tech-savvy users and deploy it too, if I find the time.

Convergence, as a project, means a lot to me; both as a software artist and as a person.

The fruition of this project (which has been in the works since 2022) marks a point of convergence in life. A moment where things started making more sense, and my purpose on this planet became crystal clear.

Love, science, philosophy, meditation, programming, human psychology, art and engineering fused together into infinity (the point of convergence). To me, it's a reminder that engineering is more than just a source of livelihood for me, it's what makes me, me.

I’ve been actively exploring the synthetic data generation space — especially multi-modal synthetic data — from a research standpoint.

Convergence is a step towards making synthetic data usable, and a point of leverage for all users of technology.

Interested in trying out Convergence?

DM me and I’ll send you a demo API key when we launch. Stay tuned.
