# ðŸ”¥ Features

Convergence offers a rich set of features for generating synthetic audio conversations.
From neural synthesis to self-hosted deployments, this platform provides everything you need for creating lifelike dialogues.

## Core Features

### ðŸ”¥ Neural Synthesis
Generate natural conversations on any topic with just one CLI command.
The AI understands context and creates realistic dialogue flows that capture the nuances of human conversation.

### ðŸ”¥ Dynamic Personas
AI-driven personalities with distinct voices. Configure personalities through:
- **Prompt**: Define the scenario and participants.
  Create detailed character descriptions and scenario setups for more engaging conversations.
- **Vibe**: Set the tone and style.
  Whether casual, professional, or philosophical, the vibe parameter shapes the entire conversation.
- **Custom Transcripts**: Use your own dialogue.
  Import pre-written scripts or conversations to generate audio with specific content.
- **Outline**: Provide structured guidance.
  Guide the AI with bullet points or structured notes to ensure key topics are covered.

### ðŸ”¥ Outline Support
Guide conversations with structured content:
- Support for local files and URLs.
  Load outlines from your filesystem or directly from web resources.
- Markdown, text, and other formats via `markitdown` conversion.
  The system intelligently converts various document formats into structured guidance.
- Use as conversation spec, protocol, or guidance.
  Outlines can define strict protocols or provide flexible conversation guidelines.
- Automatic truncation to 50KB for performance.
  Large documents are intelligently trimmed to maintain optimal processing speed.
- Graceful fallback if processing fails.
  The system continues generating conversations even if outline processing encounters issues.

### ðŸ”¥ Pre-defined Conversations
Generate audio from JSON conversation transcripts:
- Create your own transcripts manually.
  Write exact dialogues in JSON format for precise control over conversations.
- Use AI-generated transcripts.
  Let the AI create transcripts that you can review and modify before generation.
- Automatic voice assignment based on speaker gender.
  The system intelligently matches voices to speakers for consistent audio output.
- Environment variable substitution in configs.
  Use environment variables in your configurations for flexible deployments.
