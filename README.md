## 🌊 What is Convergence?

> "_Engineering is more than just a source of livelihood - it's what makes me who I am._" — AdiPat

**Convergence** transforms text prompts into lifelike audio conversations using AI. Born from weekend tinkering sessions and a deep love for programming, it's where technology meets creativity.

### ✨ One Command, Infinite Conversations.

```bash
python -m convergence --prompt "Two friends discussing the meaning of life" --duration 10
```

That's it. Convergence handles the rest - generating natural dialogue, assigning voices, and creating audio that sounds genuinely human.
