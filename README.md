## üåä About Convergence

> "_Engineering is more than just a source of livelihood - it's what makes me who I am._ ‚Äî AdiPat"

**CONVERGENCE** is an open-source platform that generates synthetic audio conversations using advanced AI. Born from weekend tinkering sessions and a deep love for programming, this project represents the convergence of technology, creativity, and human connection.

Built with passion during those precious hours between work commitments, Convergence transforms simple prompts into rich, lifelike conversations - from group discussions and podcasts to mock standups and beyond. It's a testament to what's possible when we code not just for function, but for joy.

### ‚ú® Features

## üìã Outline Feature

The outline feature allows you to guide conversations with structured content, making the generated dialogue more focused and relevant.

### CLI Usage

The CLI accepts both local files and URLs via the `--outline` or `-u` parameter:

```bash
# Local markdown file
python -m convergence --prompt "AI ethics discussion" \
                     --outline ./outlines/ai-ethics.md

# URL to online document
python -m convergence --prompt "Product review" \
                     --outline https://example.com/product-spec.md

# Non-markdown files are automatically converted
python -m convergence --prompt "Technical documentation" \
                     --outline ./docs/spec.pdf
```

### API Usage

The API only accepts URLs for security reasons:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Technical review",
  "duration": 15,
  "vibe": "Professional",
  "outline_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/outline.md"
}
```

### Supported Features

- **Format Support**: Markdown, text files, and other formats via `markitdown` conversion.
- **URL Fetching**: Direct download from HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
- **Size Limits**: Outlines are truncated to 50KB for performance.
- **Formatting**: Automatic cleanup and standardization of bullet points.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if processing fails.

---

## üó£Ô∏è Pre-defined Conversations

The conversation feature allows you to generate audio from pre-defined conversation transcripts, using OpenAI's text-to-speech API with automatic voice assignment.

### JSON Format

Create a conversation JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "transcript": {
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "gender": "female",
        "role": "Developer",
        "message": "Hey Bob, did you see the new release?",
        "timestamp": "2025-07-07T10:00:00"
      },
      {
        "name": "Bob",
        "gender": "male",
        "role": "Engineer",
        "message": "Yeah! It's amazing!",
        "timestamp": "2025-07-07T10:00:05"
      }
    ]
  },
  "config": {
    "prompt": "Two colleagues discussing tech",
    "duration": 5,
    "vibe": "Excited",
    "output_path": "output/tech_talk.wav",
    "openai_api_key": "$env.OPENAI_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

### Features

- **Automatic Voice Assignment**: Voices are automatically selected based on gender.
  - Female voices: alloy, coral, fable, nova, sage.
  - Male voices: ash, ballad, echo, onyx, shimmer.
- **Environment Variable Substitution**: Use `$env.OPENAI_API_KEY` in the config.
- **Real TTS Integration**: Uses OpenAI's `tts-1` model for high-quality speech.
- **Multi-speaker Support**: Each speaker gets a consistent voice throughout.

### Usage

```bash
# Generate audio from conversation JSON
python -m convergence --conversation ./data/conversation.json

# Override output path
python -m convergence --conversation ./data/conversation.json \
                     --output custom_output.wav
```

## üìù AI Transcript Generation

Generate realistic conversation transcripts using OpenAI's language models. The generated transcripts can then be converted to audio.

### Features

- **Smart Dialogue Generation**: Uses GPT-4.1 to create natural conversations.
- **Context Awareness**: Each response builds on previous exchanges.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Control prompt, duration, and conversation style.
- **JSON Output**: Saves in the same format as pre-defined conversations.
- **No Sensitive Data**: API keys are replaced with environment variable references.

### Usage

```bash
# Generate with specific parameters
python -m convergence --generate-transcript \
                     --prompt "Two scientists discussing quantum computing" \
                     --duration 5 \
                     --vibe "Academic and curious"

# Use defaults (casual tech conversation)
python -m convergence --generate-transcript

# Generate then convert to audio (two-step process)
python -m convergence --generate-transcript --duration 3
python -m convergence --conversation output/conversation_[timestamp].json
```

### Generated Format

The transcript generator creates JSON files with:

- Multiple dialogue exchanges (approximately 2-3 per minute).
- Consistent speaker personas throughout the conversation.
- Natural conversation flow with proper context.
- Timestamps spaced evenly across the duration.

## üß™ Development

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
./scripts/lint.sh

# Auto-fix issues
./scripts/lint.sh --fix

# Type checking
./scripts/typecheck.sh

# Security scan
./scripts/bandit.sh
```

### Building

```bash
# Build distribution
./scripts/build.sh

# Build Docker image
docker build -t convergence:latest .
```

## üîê Environment Configuration

The system uses a hierarchical environment loading strategy:

1. `.env.{environment}` (e.g., `.env.production`)
2. `.env` (default)
3. `.env.local` (local overrides)

### Required Variables

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here  # Required for transcript generation
ENVIRONMENT=development           # Optional: local/development/staging/production
```

### Authentication Variables (Optional)

Create an empty Google Sheet and setup your credentials on Google Cloud. Add these credentials to the env file should you choose to have `AUTH_ENABLED=true`. Else, you can always use the service via Docker as a sidecar or internally within your VPC.

```bash
# Enable API key authentication
AUTH_ENABLED=true

# Google Sheets configuration for API key management
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/to/service-account-key.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your-google-sheet-id-here
GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME=API_Keys  # Default: API_Keys

# API key cache settings
API_KEY_CACHE_DURATION=300  # Cache duration in seconds (default: 300)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **API Key Authentication**: Optional Google Sheets-based API key management.
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All sensitive data in environment variables.
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation on all endpoints.
- **Secure file handling**: Path validation and access controls.
- **Regular security scans**: Automated scanning with Bandit.
- **Rate limiting support**: Per-API key rate limits (when auth enabled).
